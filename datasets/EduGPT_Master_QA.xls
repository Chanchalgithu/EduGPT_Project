Read N Characters Given Read4,"Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method to read `n` characters.

Method read4: 
The API `read4` reads four consecutive characters from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

Definition of read4:
    Parameter:  char[] buf4
    Returns:    int
buf4[] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4[].

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:
File file(""abcde`""); // File is ""`abcde`"", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters
read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 = ""abcd"", fp points to 'e'
read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 = ""e"", fp points to end of file
read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 = """", fp points to end of file`
Method read:
By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Definition of read: 
    Parameters:	char[] buf, int n
    Returns:	int
buf[] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf[].

Note:
Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.

The `read` function will only be called once for each test case.

You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.


Example 1:
Input: file = ""abc"", n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain ""abc"". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.

Note that ""abc"" is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.


Example 2:
Input: file = ""abcde"", n = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain ""abcde"". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.


Example 3:
Input: file = ""abcdABCD1234"", n = 12
Output: 12
Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain ""abcdABCD1234"". We read a total of 12 characters from the file, so return 12.


Example 4:
Input: file = ""leetcode"", n = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain ""leetc"". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.


Constraints:
`1 <= file.length <= 500`
`file` consist of English letters and digits.

`1 <= n <= 1000`"

Paint Fence,"You are painting a fence of `n` posts with `k` different colors. You must paint the posts following these rules:
Every post must be painted exactly one color.

At most one pair of adjacent fence posts can have the same color.

Given the two integers `n` and `k`, return the number of ways you can paint the fence.


Example 1:
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: All the possibilities are shown.

Note that painting all the posts red or all the posts green is invalid because there can only be at most one pair of adjacent posts that are the same color.


Example 2:
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: n = 7, k = 2
Output: 42

Constraints:
`1 <= n <= 50`
`1 <= k <= 105`
The answer is guaranteed to be in the range `[0, 231 - 1]` for the given `n` and `k`."

Couples Holding Hands,"N couples sit in 2N seats arranged in a row and want to hold hands.  We want to know the minimum number of swaps so that every couple is sitting side by side.  A swap consists of choosing any two people, then they stand up and switch seats. 
The people and seats are represented by an integer from `0` to `2N-1`, the couples are numbered in order, the first couple being `(0, 1)`, the second couple being `(2, 3)`, and so on with the last couple being `(2N-2, 2N-1)`.

The couples' initial seating is given by `row[i]` being the value of the person who is initially sitting in the i-th seat.


Example 1:Input: row = [0, 2, 1, 3]

Prime Number of Set Bits in Binary Representation,"Given two integers `L` and `R`, find the count of numbers in the range `[L, R]` (inclusive) having a prime number of set bits in their binary representation.

(Recall that the number of set bits an integer has is the number of `1`s present when written in binary.  For example, `21` written in binary is `10101` which has 3 set bits.  Also, 1 is not a prime.)

Example 1:Input: L = 6, R = 10
Output: 4
Explanation:
6 -> 110 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
7 -> 111 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
9 -> 1001 (2 set bits , 2 is prime)
10->1010 (2 set bits , 2 is prime)

Example 2:Input: L = 10, R = 15
Output: 5
Explanation:
10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
11 -> 1011 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
12 -> 1100 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
13 -> 1101 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
14 -> 1110 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
15 -> 1111 (4 set bits, 4 is not prime)

Clone Binary Tree With Random Pointer,"A binary tree is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the tree or null.

Return a deep copy of the tree.

The tree is represented in the same input/output way as normal binary trees where each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:
`val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
`random_index`: the index of the node (in the input) where the random pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

You will be given the tree in class `Node` and you should return the cloned tree in class `NodeCopy`. `NodeCopy` class is just a clone of `Node` class with the same attributes and constructors.


Example 1:
Input: root = [[1,null],null,[4,3],[7,0]]
Output: [[1,null],null,[4,3],[7,0]]
Explanation: The original binary tree is [1,null,4,7].

The random pointer of node one is null, so it is represented as [1, null].

The random pointer of node 4 is node 7, so it is represented as [4, 3] where 3 is the index of node 7 in the array representing the tree.

The random pointer of node 7 is node 1, so it is represented as [7, 0] where 0 is the index of node 1 in the array representing the tree.


Example 2:
Input: root = [[1,4],null,[1,0],null,[1,5],[1,5]]
Output: [[1,4],null,[1,0],null,[1,5],[1,5]]
Explanation: The random pointer of a node can be the node itself.


Example 3:
Input: root = [[1,6],[2,5],[3,4],[4,3],[5,2],[6,1],[7,0]]
Output: [[1,6],[2,5],[3,4],[4,3],[5,2],[6,1],[7,0]]

Example 4:
Input: root = []
Output: []

Example 5:
Input: root = [[1,null],null,[2,null],null,[1,null]]
Output: [[1,null],null,[2,null],null,[1,null]]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the `tree` is in the range `[0, 1000].`

Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum,"A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any path.


Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.


Example 2:
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.

Teemo Attacking,"In LOL world, there is a hero called Teemo and his attacking can make his enemy Ashe be in poisoned condition. Now, given the Teemo's attacking ascending time series towards Ashe and the poisoning time duration per Teemo's attacking, you need to output the total time that Ashe is in poisoned condition.

You may assume that Teemo attacks at the very beginning of a specific time point, and makes Ashe be in poisoned condition immediately.


Example 1:
Input: [1,4], 2
Output: 4
Explanation: At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned immediately. 
This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2. 
And at time point 4, Teemo attacks Ashe again, and causes Ashe to be in poisoned status for another 2 seconds. 
So you finally need to output 4.


Example 2:
Input: [1,2], 2
Output: 3
Explanation: At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned. 
This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2. 
However, at the beginning of time point 2, Teemo attacks Ashe again who is already in poisoned status. 
Since the poisoned status won't add up together, though the second poisoning attack will still work at time point 2, it will stop at the end of time point 3. 
So you finally need to output 3.

Note:
You may assume the length of given time series array won't exceed 10000.

You may assume the numbers in the Teemo's attacking time series and his poisoning time duration per attacking are non-negative integers, which won't exceed 10,000,000."

Implement Trie (Prefix Tree),"A trie (pronounced as ""try"") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

Implement the Trie class:
`Trie()` Initializes the trie object.

`void insert(String word)` Inserts the string `word` into the trie.

`boolean search(String word)` Returns `true` if the string `word` is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and `false` otherwise.

`boolean startsWith(String prefix)` Returns `true` if there is a previously inserted string `word` that has the prefix `prefix`, and `false` otherwise.


Example 1:
Input
[""Trie"", ""insert"", ""search"", ""search"", ""startsWith"", ""insert"", ""search""]
[[], [""apple""], [""apple""], [""app""], [""app""], [""app""], [""app""]]
Output
[null, null, true, false, true, null, true]
Explanation
Trie trie = new Trie();
trie.insert(""apple"");
trie.search(""apple"");   // return True
trie.search(""app"");     // return False
trie.startsWith(""app""); // return True
trie.insert(""app"");
trie.search(""app"");     // return True

Constraints:
`1 <= word.length, prefix.length <= 2000`

Asteroid Collision,"We are given an array `asteroids` of integers representing asteroids in a row.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.


Example 1:
Input: asteroids = [5,10,-5]
Output: [5,10]
Explanation: The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10. The 5 and 10 never collide.


Example 2:
Input: asteroids = [8,-8]
Output: []
Explanation: The 8 and -8 collide exploding each other.


Example 3:
Input: asteroids = [10,2,-5]
Output: [10]
Explanation: The 2 and -5 collide resulting in -5. The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.


Example 4:
Input: asteroids = [-2,-1,1,2]
Output: [-2,-1,1,2]
Explanation: The -2 and -1 are moving left, while the 1 and 2 are moving right. Asteroids moving the same direction never meet, so no asteroids will meet each other.

Cat and Mouse,"A game on an undirected graph is played by two players, Mouse and Cat, who alternate turns.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[a]` is a list of all nodes `b` such that `ab` is an edge of the graph.

The mouse starts at node `1` and goes first, the cat starts at node `2` and goes second, and there is a hole at node `0`.

During each player's turn, they must travel along one edge of the graph that meets where they are.  For example, if the Mouse is at node 1, it must travel to any node in `graph[1]`.

Additionally, it is not allowed for the Cat to travel to the Hole (node 0.)
Then, the game can end in three ways:
If ever the Cat occupies the same node as the Mouse, the Cat wins.

If ever the Mouse reaches the Hole, the Mouse wins.

If ever a position is repeated (i.e., the players are in the same position as a previous turn, and it is the same player's turn to move), the game is a draw.

Given a `graph`, and assuming both players play optimally, return
`1` if the mouse wins the game,
`2` if the cat wins the game, or
`0` if the game is a draw.


Example 1:
Input: graph = [[2,5],[3],[0,4,5],[1,4,5],[2,3],[0,2,3]]
Output: 0

Example 2:
Input: graph = [[1,3],[0],[3],[0,2]]
Output: 1

Constraints:
`3 <= graph.length <= 50`
`1 <= graph[i].length < graph.length`
`0 <= graph[i][j] < graph.length`
`graph[i][j] != i`

The mouse and the cat can always move."

Design Hit Counter,"Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past `5` minutes (i.e., the past `300` seconds).

Your system should accept a `timestamp` parameter (in seconds granularity), and you may assume that calls are being made to the system in chronological order (i.e., `timestamp` is monotonically increasing). Several hits may arrive roughly at the same time.

Implement the `HitCounter` class:
`HitCounter()` Initializes the object of the hit counter system.

`void hit(int timestamp)` Records a hit that happened at `timestamp` (in seconds). Several hits may happen at the same `timestamp`.

`int getHits(int timestamp)` Returns the number of hits in the past 5 minutes from `timestamp` (i.e., the past `300` seconds).


Example 1:
Input
[""HitCounter"", ""hit"", ""hit"", ""hit"", ""getHits"", ""hit"", ""getHits"", ""getHits""]
[[], [1], [2], [3], [4], [300], [300], [301]]
Output
[null, null, null, null, 3, null, 4, 3]
Explanation
HitCounter hitCounter = new HitCounter();
hitCounter.hit(1);       // hit at timestamp 1.

hitCounter.hit(2);       // hit at timestamp 2.

hitCounter.hit(3);       // hit at timestamp 3.

hitCounter.getHits(4);   // get hits at timestamp 4, return 3.

hitCounter.hit(300);     // hit at timestamp 300.

hitCounter.getHits(300); // get hits at timestamp 300, return 4.

hitCounter.getHits(301); // get hits at timestamp 301, return 3.


Constraints:
`1 <= timestamp <= 2 * 109`
All the calls are being made to the system in chronological order (i.e., `timestamp` is monotonically increasing).

At most `300` calls will be made to `hit` and `getHits`.

Binary Search Tree Iterator,"Implement the `BSTIterator` class that represents an iterator over the in-order traversal of a binary search tree (BST):
`BSTIterator(TreeNode root)` Initializes an object of the `BSTIterator` class. The `root` of the BST is given as part of the constructor. The pointer should be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element in the BST.

`boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there exists a number in the traversal to the right of the pointer, otherwise returns `false`.

`int next()` Moves the pointer to the right, then returns the number at the pointer.

Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the first call to `next()` will return the smallest element in the BST.

You may assume that `next()` calls will always be valid. That is, there will be at least a next number in the in-order traversal when `next()` is called.


Example 1:
Input
[""BSTIterator"", ""next"", ""next"", ""hasNext"", ""next"", ""hasNext"", ""next"", ""hasNext"", ""next"", ""hasNext""]
[[[7, 3, 15, null, null, 9, 20]], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]
Output
[null, 3, 7, true, 9, true, 15, true, 20, false]
Explanation
BSTIterator bSTIterator = new BSTIterator([7, 3, 15, null, null, 9, 20]);
bSTIterator.next();    // return 3
bSTIterator.next();    // return 7
bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True
bSTIterator.next();    // return 9
bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True
bSTIterator.next();    // return 15
bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True
bSTIterator.next();    // return 20
bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return False

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 105]`.

`0 <= Node.val <= 106`
At most `105` calls will be made to `hasNext`, and `next`.

Follow up:
Could you implement `next()` and `hasNext()` to run in average `O(1)` time and use `O(h)` memory, where `h` is the height of the tree?"

Find Median from Data Stream,"The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

For example, for `arr = [2,3,4]`, the median is `3`.

For example, for `arr = [2,3]`, the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

Implement the MedianFinder class:
`MedianFinder()` initializes the `MedianFinder` object.

`void addNum(int num)` adds the integer `num` from the data stream to the data structure.

`double findMedian()` returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.


Example 1:
Input
[""MedianFinder"", ""addNum"", ""addNum"", ""findMedian"", ""addNum"", ""findMedian""]
[[], [1], [2], [], [3], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 1.5, null, 2.0]
Explanation
MedianFinder medianFinder = new MedianFinder();
medianFinder.addNum(1);    // arr = [1]
medianFinder.addNum(2);    // arr = [1, 2]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 1.5 (i.e., (1 + 2) / 2)
medianFinder.addNum(3);    // arr[1, 2, 3]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 2.0

Constraints:
`-105 <= num <= 105`

Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together,"Given a binary array `data`, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all `1`’s present in the array together in any place in the array.


Example 1:
Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
There are 3 ways to group all 1's together:
[1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.

[0,1,1,1,0] using 2 swaps.

[0,0,1,1,1] using 1 swap.

The minimum is 1.


Example 2:
Input: data = [0,0,0,1,0]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
Since there is only one 1 in the array, no swaps needed.


Example 3:
Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
One possible solution that uses 3 swaps is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1].


Example 4:
Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1]

Happy Number,"Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.

Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.

Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

Return `true` if `n` is a happy number, and `false` if not.


Example 1:
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

Example 2:

Random Pick with Weight,"You are given an array of positive integers `w` where `w[i]` describes the weight of `i``th` index (0-indexed).

We need to call the function `pickIndex()` which randomly returns an integer in the range `[0, w.length - 1]`. `pickIndex()` should return the integer proportional to its weight in the `w` array. For example, for `w = [1, 3]`, the probability of picking the index `0` is `1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25` (i.e 25%) while the probability of picking the index `1` is `3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75` (i.e 75%).

More formally, the probability of picking index `i` is `w[i] / sum(w)`.


Example 1:
Input
[""Solution"",""pickIndex""]
[[[1]],[]]
Output
[null,0]
Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. Since there is only one single element on the array the only option is to return the first element.


Example 2:
Input
[""Solution"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex""]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,1,1,1,1,0]
Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It's returning the second element (index = 1) that has probability of 3/4.

solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It's returning the first element (index = 0) that has probability of 1/4.

Since this is a randomization problem, multiple answers are allowed so the following outputs can be considered correct :
[null,1,1,1,1,0]
[null,1,1,1,1,1]
[null,1,1,1,0,0]
[null,1,1,1,0,1]
[null,1,0,1,0,0]
......

and so on.


Constraints:
`1 <= w.length <= 10000`
`1 <= w[i] <= 10^5`
`pickIndex` will be called at most `10000` times."

Number of Distinct Islands II,"Given a non-empty 2D array `grid` of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.)  You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Count the number of distinct islands.  An island is considered to be the same as another if they have the same shape, or have the same shape after rotation (90, 180, or 270 degrees only) or reflection (left/right direction or up/down direction).


Example 1:
11000
10000
00001
00011
Given the above grid map, return `1`.

Notice that:
11
1
and
 1
11
are considered same island shapes. Because if we make a 180 degrees clockwise rotation on the first island, then two islands will have the same shapes.


Example 2:
11100
10001
01001
01110
Given the above grid map, return `2`.

Here are the two distinct islands:
111
1
and
1
1
Notice that:
111
1
and
1
111
are considered same island shapes. Because if we flip the first array in the up/down direction, then they have the same shapes.

Note:
The length of each dimension in the given `grid` does not exceed 50."

Fraction Addition and Subtraction,"Given a string representing an expression of fraction addition and subtraction, you need to return the calculation result in string format. The final result should be irreducible fraction. If your final result is an integer, say `2`, you need to change it to the format of fraction that has denominator `1`. So in this case, `2` should be converted to `2/1`.


Example 1:
Input:""-1/2+1/2""
Output: ""0/1""

Example 2:
Input:""-1/2+1/2+1/3""
Output: ""1/3""

Example 3:
Input:""1/3-1/2""
Output: ""-1/6""

Example 4:
Input:""5/3+1/3""
Output: ""2/1""
Note:
The input string only contains `'0'` to `'9'`, `'/'`, `'+'` and `'-'`. So does the output.

Each fraction (input and output) has format `±numerator/denominator`. If the first input fraction or the output is positive, then `'+'` will be omitted.

The input only contains valid irreducible fractions, where the numerator and denominator of each fraction will always be in the range [1,10]. If the denominator is 1, it means this fraction is actually an integer in a fraction format defined above.

The number of given fractions will be in the range [1,10].

The numerator and denominator of the final result are guaranteed to be valid and in the range of 32-bit int."

Number of Distinct Islands,"Given a non-empty 2D array `grid` of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.)  You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Count the number of distinct islands.  An island is considered to be the same as another if and only if one island can be translated (and not rotated or reflected) to equal the other.


Example 1:
11000
11000
00011
00011
Given the above grid map, return `1`.


Example 2:
11011
10000
00001
11011
Given the above grid map, return `3`.

Notice that:
11
1
and

11
are considered different island shapes, because we do not consider reflection / rotation.

Note:
The length of each dimension in the given `grid` does not exceed 50."

Unique Paths II,"A robot is located at the top-left corner of a `m x n` grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
An obstacle and space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

Minimum Cost to Connect Sticks,"You have some number of sticks with positive integer lengths. These lengths are given as an array `sticks`, where `sticks[i]` is the length of the `ith` stick.

You can connect any two sticks of lengths `x` and `y` into one stick by paying a cost of `x + y`. You must connect all the sticks until there is only one stick remaining.

Return the minimum cost of connecting all the given sticks into one stick in this way.


Example 1:
Input: sticks = [2,4,3]
Output: 14
Explanation: You start with sticks = [2,4,3].

1. Combine sticks 2 and 3 for a cost of 2 + 3 = 5. Now you have sticks = [5,4].

2. Combine sticks 5 and 4 for a cost of 5 + 4 = 9. Now you have sticks = [9].

There is only one stick left, so you are done. The total cost is 5 + 9 = 14.


Example 2:
Input: sticks = [1,8,3,5]
Output: 30
Explanation: You start with sticks = [1,8,3,5].

1. Combine sticks 1 and 3 for a cost of 1 + 3 = 4. Now you have sticks = [4,8,5].

2. Combine sticks 4 and 5 for a cost of 4 + 5 = 9. Now you have sticks = [9,8].

3. Combine sticks 9 and 8 for a cost of 9 + 8 = 17. Now you have sticks = [17].

There is only one stick left, so you are done. The total cost is 4 + 9 + 17 = 30.


Example 3:
Input: sticks = [5]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is only one stick, so you don't need to do anything. The total cost is 0.

Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286, k = 2
Output: [4,3]

Example 2:
Input: root = [1], target = 0.000000, k = 1
Output: [1]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.

`1 <= k <= n <= 104`.

`0 <= Node.val <= 109`
`-109 <= target <= 109`
Follow up: Assume that the BST is balanced. Could you solve it in less than `O(n)` runtime (where `n = total nodes`)?"

Generate Random Point in a Circle,"Given the radius and the position of the center of a circle, implement the function `randPoint` which generates a uniform random point inside the circle.

Implement the `Solution` class:
`Solution(double radius, double x_center, double y_center)` initializes the object with the radius of the circle `radius` and the position of the center `(x_center, y_center)`.

`randPoint()` returns a random point inside the circle. A point on the circumference of the circle is considered to be in the circle. The answer is returned as an array `[x, y]`.


Example 1:
Input
[""Solution"", ""randPoint"", ""randPoint"", ""randPoint""]
[[1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [], [], []]
Output
[null, [-0.02493, -0.38077], [0.82314, 0.38945], [0.36572, 0.17248]]
Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution(1.0, 0.0, 0.0);
solution.randPoint(); // return [-0.02493, -0.38077]
solution.randPoint(); // return [0.82314, 0.38945]
solution.randPoint(); // return [0.36572, 0.17248]

Constraints:
`0 < radius <= 108`
`-107 <= x_center, y_center <= 107`
At most `3 * 104` calls will be made to `randPoint`."

Game of Life,"According to Wikipedia's article: ""The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.""
The board is made up of an `m x n` grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a `1`) or dead (represented by a `0`). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.

Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.

Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.

Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the `m x n` grid `board`, return the next state.


Example 1:
Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]

Example 2:
Input: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]

Constraints:
`m == board.length`
`n == board[i].length`
`1 <= m, n <= 25`
`board[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

Follow up:
Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.

In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?"

Flatten 2D Vector,"Design an iterator to flatten a 2D vector. It should support the `next` and `hasNext` operations.

Implement the `Vector2D` class:
`Vector2D(int[][] vec)` initializes the object with the 2D vector `vec`.

`next()` returns the next element from the 2D vector and moves the pointer one step forward. You may assume that all the calls to `next` are valid.

`hasNext()` returns `true` if there are still some elements in the vector, and `false` otherwise.


Example 1:
Input
[""Vector2D"", ""next"", ""next"", ""next"", ""hasNext"", ""hasNext"", ""next"", ""hasNext""]
[[[[1, 2], [3], [4]]], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]
Output
[null, 1, 2, 3, true, true, 4, false]
Explanation
Vector2D vector2D = new Vector2D([[1, 2], [3], [4]]);
vector2D.next();    // return 1
vector2D.next();    // return 2
vector2D.next();    // return 3
vector2D.hasNext(); // return True
vector2D.hasNext(); // return True
vector2D.next();    // return 4
vector2D.hasNext(); // return False

Constraints:
`0 <= vec.length <= 200`
`0 <= vec[i].length <= 500`
`-500 <= vec[i][j] <= 500`
At most `105` calls will be made to `next` and `hasNext`.

Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree,"Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Example 1:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.


Example 2:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.


Example 3:
Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.

Student Attendance Record II,"An attendance record for a student can be represented as a string where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:
`'A'`: Absent.

`'L'`: Late.

`'P'`: Present.

Any student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:
The student was absent (`'A'`) for strictly fewer than 2 days total.

The student was never late (`'L'`) for 3 or more consecutive days.

Given an integer `n`, return the number of possible attendance records of length `n` that make a student eligible for an attendance award. The answer may be very large, so return it modulo `109 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 records with length 2 that are eligible for an award:
""PP"", ""AP"", ""PA"", ""LP"", ""PL"", ""AL"", ""LA"", ""LL""
Only ""AA"" is not eligible because there are 2 absences (there need to be fewer than 2).

Redundant Connection II,"In this problem, a rooted tree is a directed graph such that, there is exactly one node (the root) for which all other nodes are descendants of this node, plus every node has exactly one parent, except for the root node which has no parents.

The given input is a directed graph that started as a rooted tree with `n` nodes (with distinct values from `1` to `n`), with one additional directed edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from `1` to `n`, and was not an edge that already existed.

The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of `edges`. Each element of `edges` is a pair `[ui, vi]` that represents a directed edge connecting nodes `ui` and `vi`, where `ui` is a parent of child `vi`.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a rooted tree of `n` nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array.


Example 1:
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,3]

Example 2:
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,5]]

Patching Array,"Given a sorted integer array `nums` and an integer `n`, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in the range `[1, n]` inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array.

Return the minimum number of patches required.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3], n = 6
Output: 1
Explanation:
Combinations of nums are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3, 4.

Now if we add/patch 2 to nums, the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].

Possible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].

So we only need 1 patch.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,5,10], n = 20
Output: 2
Explanation: The two patches can be [2, 4].


Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,2], n = 5
Output: 0

`1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
`1 <= nums[i] <= 104`
`nums` is sorted in ascending order.

Best Meeting Point,"Given an `m x n` binary grid `grid` where each `1` marks the home of one friend, return the minimal total travel distance.

The total travel distance is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.

The distance is calculated using Manhattan Distance, where `distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|`.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Given three friends living at (0,0), (0,4), and (2,2).

The point (0,2) is an ideal meeting point, as the total travel distance of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 is minimal.

So return 6.


Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1,1]]
Output: 1

Constraints:
`m == grid.length`
`n == grid[i].length`
`1 <= m, n <= 200`
`grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

There will be at least two friends in the `grid`."

Maximum Average Subarray II,"You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of `n` elements, and an integer `k`.

Find a contiguous subarray whose length is greater than or equal to `k` that has the maximum average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less than `10-5` will be accepted.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
Output: 12.75000
Explanation:
- When the length is 4, averages are [0.5, 12.75, 10.5] and the maximum average is 12.75
- When the length is 5, averages are [10.4, 10.8] and the maximum average is 10.8
- When the length is 6, averages are [9.16667] and the maximum average is 9.16667
The maximum average is when we choose a subarray of length 4 (i.e., the sub array [12, -5, -6, 50]) which has the max average 12.75, so we return 12.75
Note that we do not consider the subarrays of length < 4.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [5], k = 1
Output: 5.00000

Constraints:
`n == nums.length`
`1 <= k <= n <= 104`

Largest Plus Sign,"In a 2D `grid` from (0, 0) to (N-1, N-1), every cell contains a `1`, except those cells in the given list `mines` which are `0`.  What is the largest axis-aligned plus sign of `1`s contained in the grid?  Return the order of the plus sign.  If there is none, return 0.

An ""axis-aligned plus sign of `1`s of order k"" has some center `grid[x][y] = 1` along with 4 arms of length `k-1` going up, down, left, and right, and made of `1`s.  This is demonstrated in the diagrams below.  Note that there could be `0`s or `1`s beyond the arms of the plus sign, only the relevant area of the plus sign is checked for 1s.


Examples of Axis-Aligned Plus Signs of Order k:Order 1:
000
010
000
Order 2:
00000
00100
01110
00100
00000
Order 3:
0000000
0001000
0001000
0111110
0001000
0001000
0000000

Example 1:Input: N = 5, mines = [[4, 2]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
11111
11111
11111
11111
11011
In the above grid, the largest plus sign can only be order 2.  One of them is marked in bold.


Example 2:Input: N = 2, mines = []
Output: 1
Explanation:
There is no plus sign of order 2, but there is of order 1.


Example 3:Input: N = 1, mines = [[0, 0]]
Output: 0
Explanation:
There is no plus sign, so return 0.

Note:
`N` will be an integer in the range `[1, 500]`.

`mines` will have length at most `5000`.

`mines[i]` will be length 2 and consist of integers in the range `[0, N-1]`.

Longest Uncommon Subsequence I,"Given two strings `a` and `b`, find the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between them.

A subsequence of a string `s` is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from `s`. For example, `""abc""` is a subsequence of `""aebdc""` because you can delete the underlined characters in `""aebdc""` to get `""abc""`. Other subsequences of `""aebdc""` include `""aebdc""`, `""aeb""`, and `""""` (empty string).

An uncommon subsequence between two strings is a string that is a subsequence of one but not the other.

Return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between `a` and `b`. If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return `-1`.


Example 1:
Input: a = ""aba"", b = ""cdc""
Output: 3
Explanation: One longest uncommon subsequence is ""aba"" because ""aba"" is a subsequence of ""aba"" but not ""cdc"".

Note that ""cdc"" is also a longest uncommon subsequence.


Example 2:
Input: a = ""aaa"", b = ""bbb""
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest uncommon subsequences are ""aaa"" and ""bbb"".


Example 3:
Input: a = ""aaa"", b = ""aaa""
Output: -1
Explanation: Every subsequence of string a is also a subsequence of string b. Similarly, every subsequence of string b is also a subsequence of string a.

Jump Game VI,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

You are initially standing at index `0`. In one move, you can jump at most `k` steps forward without going outside the boundaries of the array. That is, you can jump from index `i` to any index in the range `[i + 1, min(n - 1, i + k)]` inclusive.

You want to reach the last index of the array (index `n - 1`). Your score is the sum of all `nums[j]` for each index `j` you visited in the array.

Return the maximum score you can get.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,-1,-2,4,-7,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: You can choose your jumps forming the subsequence [1,-1,4,3] (underlined above). The sum is 7.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [10,-5,-2,4,0,3], k = 3

Delete N Nodes After M Nodes of a Linked List,"Given the `head` of a linked list and two integers `m` and `n`. Traverse the linked list and remove some nodes in the following way:
Start with the head as the current node.

Keep the first `m` nodes starting with the current node.

Remove the next `n` nodes
Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until you reach the end of the list.

Return the head of the modified list after removing the mentioned nodes.

Follow up question: How can you solve this problem by modifying the list in-place?

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13], m = 2, n = 3
Output: [1,2,6,7,11,12]
Explanation: Keep the first (m = 2) nodes starting from the head of the linked List  (1 ->2) show in black nodes.

Delete the next (n = 3) nodes (3 -> 4 -> 5) show in read nodes.

Continue with the same procedure until reaching the tail of the Linked List.

Head of linked list after removing nodes is returned.


Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], m = 1, n = 3
Output: [1,5,9]
Explanation: Head of linked list after removing nodes is returned.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.

Notice that you should not modify the linked list.


Example 1:
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.


Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.


Example 3:
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.


Constraints:
The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.

`-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
`pos` is `-1` or a valid index in the linked-list.

Follow up: Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?"

Minimum Cost to Move Chips to The Same Position,"We have `n` chips, where the position of the `ith` chip is `position[i]`.

We need to move all the chips to the same position. In one step, we can change the position of the `ith` chip from `position[i]` to:
`position[i] + 2` or `position[i] - 2` with `cost = 0`.

`position[i] + 1` or `position[i] - 1` with `cost = 1`.

Return the minimum cost needed to move all the chips to the same position.


Example 1:
Input: position = [1,2,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: First step: Move the chip at position 3 to position 1 with cost = 0.

Second step: Move the chip at position 2 to position 1 with cost = 1.

H-Index II,"Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper and `citations` is sorted in an ascending order, return compute the researcher's `h`-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index `h` if `h` of their `n` papers have at least `h` citations each, and the other `n − h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.

If there are several possible values for `h`, the maximum one is taken as the `h`-index.


Example 1:
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.

Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.


Example 2:
Input: citations = [1,2,100]
Output: 2

Constraints:
`n == citations.length`
`1 <= n <= 105`
`0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`

Copy List with Random Pointer,"A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

For example, if there are two nodes `X` and `Y` in the original list, where `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes `x` and `y` in the copied list, `x.random --> y`.

Return the head of the copied linked list.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of `n` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:
`val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
`random_index`: the index of the node (range from `0` to `n-1`) that the `random` pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

Your code will only be given the `head` of the original linked list.


Example 1:
Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]

Example 2:
Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]

Example 3:
Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]

Example 4:
Input: head = []
Output: []
Explanation: The given linked list is empty (null pointer), so return null.


Constraints:
`0 <= n <= 1000`
`-10000 <= Node.val <= 10000`
`Node.random` is `null` or is pointing to some node in the linked list."

Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array,"Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is rotated between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:
`[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.

`[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that rotating an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.


Example 3:
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 

Constraints:
`n == nums.length`
`1 <= n <= 5000`
`-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
All the integers of `nums` are unique.

`nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times."

Validate IP Address,"Given a string `IP`, return `""IPv4""` if IP is a valid IPv4 address, `""IPv6""` if IP is a valid IPv6 address or `""Neither""` if IP is not a correct IP of any type.

A valid IPv4 address is an IP in the form `""x1.x2.x3.x4""` where `0 <= xi <= 255` and `xi` cannot contain leading zeros. For example, `""192.168.1.1""` and `""192.168.1.0""` are valid IPv4 addresses but `""192.168.01.1""`, while `""192.168.1.00""` and `""192.168@1.1""` are invalid IPv4 addresses.

A valid IPv6 address is an IP in the form `""x1:x2:x3:x4:x5:x6:x7:x8""` where:
`1 <= xi.length <= 4`
`xi` is a hexadecimal string which may contain digits, lower-case English letter (`'a'` to `'f'`) and upper-case English letters (`'A'` to `'F'`).

Leading zeros are allowed in `xi`.

Minimum Cost For Tickets,"In a country popular for train travel, you have planned some train travelling one year in advance.  The days of the year that you will travel is given as an array `days`.  Each day is an integer from `1` to `365`.

Train tickets are sold in 3 different ways:
a 1-day pass is sold for `costs[0]` dollars;
a 7-day pass is sold for `costs[1]` dollars;
a 30-day pass is sold for `costs[2]` dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.  For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of `days`.


Example 1:
Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 11
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.

On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.

On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.

In total you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.


Example 2:
Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 17
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.

On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.

In total you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.

Note:
`1 <= days.length <= 365`
`1 <= days[i] <= 365`
`days` is in strictly increasing order.

`costs.length == 3`
`1 <= costs[i] <= 1000`"

Decode Ways,"A message containing letters from `A-Z` can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:
'A' -> ""1""
'B' -> ""2""
...

'Z' -> ""26""
To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, `""11106""` can be mapped into:
`""AAJF""` with the grouping `(1 1 10 6)`
`""KJF""` with the grouping `(11 10 6)`
Note that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `""06""` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `""6""` is different from `""06""`.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.


Example 1:
Input: s = ""12""
Output: 2
Explanation: ""12"" could be decoded as ""AB"" (1 2) or ""L"" (12).


Example 2:
Input: s = ""226""
Output: 3
Explanation: ""226"" could be decoded as ""BZ"" (2 26), ""VF"" (22 6), or ""BBF"" (2 2 6).


Example 3:
Input: s = ""0""
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no character that is mapped to a number starting with 0.

The only valid mappings with 0 are 'J' -> ""10"" and 'T' -> ""20"", neither of which start with 0.

Hence, there are no valid ways to decode this since all digits need to be mapped.


Example 4:
Input: s = ""06""
Output: 0
Explanation: ""06"" cannot be mapped to ""F"" because of the leading zero (""6"" is different from ""06"").


Constraints:
`1 <= s.length <= 100`
`s` contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s)."

Beautiful Arrangement,"Suppose you have `n` integers labeled `1` through `n`. A permutation of those `n` integers `perm` (1-indexed) is considered a beautiful arrangement if for every `i` (`1 <= i <= n`), either of the following is true:
`perm[i]` is divisible by `i`.

`i` is divisible by `perm[i]`.

Given an integer `n`, return the number of the beautiful arrangements that you can construct.


Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The first beautiful arrangement is [1,2]:
    - perm[1] = 1 is divisible by i = 1
    - perm[2] = 2 is divisible by i = 2
The second beautiful arrangement is [2,1]:
    - perm[1] = 2 is divisible by i = 1
    - i = 2 is divisible by perm[2] = 1

Special Binary String,"Special binary strings are binary strings with the following two properties:
The number of 0's is equal to the number of 1's.

Every prefix of the binary string has at least as many 1's as 0's.

Given a special string `S`, a move consists of choosing two consecutive, non-empty, special substrings of `S`, and swapping them.  (Two strings are consecutive if the last character of the first string is exactly one index before the first character of the second string.)
At the end of any number of moves, what is the lexicographically largest resulting string possible?

Example 1:
Input: S = ""11011000""
Output: ""11100100""
Explanation:
The strings ""10"" [occuring at S[1]] and ""1100"" [at S[3]] are swapped.

This is the lexicographically largest string possible after some number of swaps.

Note:
`S` has length at most `50`.

`S` is guaranteed to be a special binary string as defined above."

Find the Celebrity,"Suppose you are at a party with `n` people (labeled from `0` to `n - 1`), and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other `n - 1` people know him/her, but he/she does not know any of them.

Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing you are allowed to do is to ask questions like: ""Hi, A. Do you know B?"" to get information about whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).

You are given a helper function `bool knows(a, b)` which tells you whether A knows B. Implement a function `int findCelebrity(n)`. There will be exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party. Return the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return `-1`.


Example 1:
Input: graph = [[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph[i][j] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph[i][j] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.


Example 2:
Input: graph = [[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no celebrity.


Constraints:
`n == graph.length`
`n == graph[i].length`
`2 <= n <= 100`
`graph[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

`graph[i][i] == 1`

Inorder Successor in BST,"Given the `root` of a binary search tree and a node `p` in it, return the in-order successor of that node in the BST. If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return `null`.

The successor of a node `p` is the node with the smallest key greater than `p.val`.


Example 1:
Input: root = [2,1,3], p = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type.


Example 2:
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], p = 6
Output: null
Explanation: There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is `null`.


Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.

`-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
All Nodes will have unique values."

Construct String from Binary Tree,"You need to construct a string consists of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversing way.

The null node needs to be represented by empty parenthesis pair ""()"". And you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that don't affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.


Example 1:
Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,4]
       1
     /   \
    2     3
   /    
  4     
Output: ""1(2(4))(3)""
Explanation: Originallay it needs to be ""1(2(4)())(3()())"", but you need to omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be ""1(2(4))(3)"".


Example 2:
Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,null,4]
       1
     /   \
    2     3
     \  
      4 
Output: ""1(2()(4))(3)""
Explanation: Almost the same as the first example, except we can't omit the first parenthesis pair to break the one-to-one mapping relationship between the input and the output."
Design Compressed String Iterator,"Design and implement a data structure for a compressed string iterator. The given compressed string will be in the form of each letter followed by a positive integer representing the number of this letter existing in the original uncompressed string.

Implement the StringIterator class:
`next()` Returns the next character if the original string still has uncompressed characters, otherwise returns a white space.

`hasNext()` Returns true if there is any letter needs to be uncompressed in the original string, otherwise returns `false`.


Example 1:
Input
[""StringIterator"", ""next"", ""next"", ""next"", ""next"", ""next"", ""next"", ""hasNext"", ""next"", ""hasNext""]
[[""L1e2t1C1o1d1e1""], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]
Output
[null, ""L"", ""e"", ""e"", ""t"", ""C"", ""o"", true, ""d"", true]
Explanation
StringIterator stringIterator = new StringIterator(""L1e2t1C1o1d1e1"");
stringIterator.next(); // return ""L""
stringIterator.next(); // return ""e""
stringIterator.next(); // return ""e""
stringIterator.next(); // return ""t""
stringIterator.next(); // return ""C""
stringIterator.next(); // return ""o""
stringIterator.hasNext(); // return True
stringIterator.next(); // return ""d""
stringIterator.hasNext(); // return True

Constraints:
`1 <= compressedString.length <= 1000`
`compressedString` consists of lower-case an upper-case English letters and digits.

The number of a single character repetitions in `compressedString` is in the range `[1, 10^9]`
At most `100` calls will be made to `next` and `hasNext`."

Next Greater Element II,"Given a circular integer array `nums` (i.e., the next element of `nums[nums.length - 1]` is `nums[0]`), return the next greater number for every element in `nums`.

The next greater number of a number `x` is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return `-1` for this number.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number. 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]

`1 <= nums.length <= 104`
`-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`"

Online Election,"In an election, the `i`-th vote was cast for `persons[i]` at time `times[i]`.

Now, we would like to implement the following query function: `TopVotedCandidate.q(int t)` will return the number of the person that was leading the election at time `t`.  
Votes cast at time `t` will count towards our query.  In the case of a tie, the most recent vote (among tied candidates) wins.


Example 1:
Input: [""TopVotedCandidate"",""q"",""q"",""q"",""q"",""q"",""q""], [[[0,1,1,0,0,1,0],[0,5,10,15,20,25,30]],[3],[12],[25],[15],[24],[8]]
Output: [null,0,1,1,0,0,1]
Explanation: 
At time 3, the votes are [0], and 0 is leading.

At time 12, the votes are [0,1,1], and 1 is leading.

At time 25, the votes are [0,1,1,0,0,1], and 1 is leading (as ties go to the most recent vote.)
This continues for 3 more queries at time 15, 24, and 8.

Note:
`1 <= persons.length = times.length <= 5000`
`0 <= persons[i] <= persons.length`
`times` is a strictly increasing array with all elements in `[0, 10^9]`.

`TopVotedCandidate.q` is called at most `10000` times per test case.

`TopVotedCandidate.q(int t)` is always called with `t >= times[0]`."
